# RCtrl2LWin
An AutoHotKey v2 script to remap Right Control (RCtrl) to Left Windows (LWin) for game streaming setups and remote sessions.

## Overview

`RCtrl2LWin` is a simple yet powerful AutoHotKey v2 script designed for users who need functional access to the **Windows key** in remote desktop or game streaming scenarios, particularly when using tools like **Moonlight** and **Sunshine**, where the native Win key may be inaccessible or unreliable.

This script remaps the **Right Control (RCtrl)** key to act as **Left Windows (LWin)**, offering a seamless substitute that works reliably with other modifier keys.

While Sunshine offers a workaround to use the **Left Alt (LAlt)** as a Windows key substitute, that method fails when used with other modifiers (like Shift or Ctrl), and conflicts with many common keyboard shortcuts. This script solves that limitation by offering a more dependable and non-invasive solution.

## Installation
1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/).
2. Download the script (`RCtrl2LWin.ahk`).
3. Double-click the script to run it.
